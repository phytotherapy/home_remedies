QR-code
You will also find a QR-code on the repo.
This is to allow herb nurseries and sellers of dried herbs to place
this QR-code (after printing it out) on their packaging so that
customers can use this herb for making home remedies.
This is intented as a concept for these companies as they might not want
to make use of our repo, but rather clone this, change the herbal recipes
to make it suit their company completely and also not be dependant on us.
After cloning and changing the cloned repo, they can make their own QR-code
using a (freeware) online QR-code generator.
