General recipe:
Macerates are prepared by soaking plant parts in water at room temperature during 7 to 12 hours and then straining off the liquid.

Althea officinale (respiration, lungs):
2 coffee spoons (=10 grams) of chopped root (radix) is soaked in 150 ml of water at room temperature during 8 hours. Strain the root from the liquid. 
Alternatively soak 15 grams of chopped root (radix) in 150 ml of lukewarm water during 0,5 hours but stir often. Take 4 cups a day (=4x 250ml = 1 liter ?)
